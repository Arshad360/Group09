<p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p>
<p align="justify">This era is called the era of science and technology. In the last couple of years, this earth changes incredibly fast. Our country is also improving itself rapidly. E- commerce business is flourishing in Bangladesh recently. A new horizon has been opened up for business, to be specific electronic commerce (E-commerce) by the Internet. In Bangladesh, a population of 165 million with 33% mobile internet user, the E-commerce market is, by all means considerably potential in upcoming days. A bulk portion of the business at present is working under the e-commerce criteria over digital networks.</p>

<p align="justify">The E-commerce web application Easy-Shopify is intended to provide complete solutions for the vendor as well as customers through a single gateway using the Internet.</p>   

<p align="justify">Easy-Shopify is a web-based e-commerce application where buyer and seller can connect with each other, and buy or sell their desired products. It will be a market place which will operate in markets of Bangladesh. Easy-Shopify will create an Internet-based marketplace where seller can lay bare their products and buyers can choose and buy their required or things which they need. It will be an excellent platform for both buyer and sellers. Easy-Shopify will introduce with a business model of selling products to customers from third-party retailers to sell their products through the site. We will add a 2-day guaranteed delivery service all around Bangladesh, will also maintain the hygiene and will make sure the product will be received totally as it is. Entrepreneurs also can use this platform. Sellers or those warehouse who use my platform for lay bare their products, have to give some percentage for using this platform. We will charge sellers or warehouses a minimum percentage on their profit.</p>

<p><strong>Why Use This Website?</strong></p>
<p align="justify">In the Easy-Shopify website, we will try to solve some problems of existing e-commerce website of our country like Evaly, Daraz etc.</p>

<p><strong>Problem 1: Fake Products</strong></p>
<p align="justify">A lot of the e-commerce websites that are present today contain many fake products and are full of scammers. Hence, buyers have a hard time distinguishing between fake products and original products.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p align="justify">In our website, we will make a rule for the seller to avoid this. When a seller uploads a product s/he will have to upload original photos and an unboxing video of the
product.</p>
<p><strong>Problem 2: Delivery Time</strong></p>
<p>Delivery time is too long for most of the e-commerce sites in our country.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p align="justify">Most of the e-commerce sites use third party delivery system. We will control the delivery system. After getting the order, we will collect products from the seller and deliver it to the customer. We can build warehouses in the city area and can store most of the common items to reduce delivery time.</p>
<p><strong>Problem 3: Return and Refund</strong></p>
<p align="justify">A survey showed that 63% of American consumers check the return policy before making a purchase, the same in our country. Here return, and refund policy is not clear. Even, most of the e-commerce sites do not give refund properly.</p>
<p><strong>Problem 4: Customer Loyalty</strong></p>
<p align="justify">It can cost up to 5 times more to acquire a new customer than retaining an existing one. The success rate of selling to a current customer is 60-70% compared to only 5-20% Success rate of selling to a new customer, but most of the sites cannot hold up their exciting customer.</p>

<ul>
  <li>User friendly interface</li>
  <li>Fast access to database</li>
  <li>Search facility</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><strong>TECHNOLOGY</strong></p>
<p>We decided to go with latest technologies for developing this application in order to give users a better experience.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENT</strong></p>
<p>1. Hardware Required
<ul>
  <li>Processor : Pentium IV or Above.</li>
  <li>Ram : 2GB or above.</li>
  <li>Hard Disk : 50GB or Above</li>
  <li>Input Device : Keyboard, Mouse, Touchpad</li>
  <li>Output Device : Monitor</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>2. Software Required

  <li>Operating System : Linux, Mac, Windows XP, 7, 8, 8.1, 10</li>
  <li>Frontend : HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript</li>
  <li>Backend : Python, MySQL</li>
  <li>Local host : XAMPP</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><strong>FRAMEWORK</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Django</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><strong>PROJECT DATABASE AND TABLE</strong></p>
<p>1. Database</p>
<p align="justify">In the project I used the MySQL database. It is the database system used on the web. It runs on a server. It is ideal for both small and large applications. Therefore it is very fast, reliable, and easy to use. It uses the standard SQL. It compiles on a number of platforms and moreover it is free to download and use. It was developed, distributed, and supported by Oracle Corporation. In Figure 2, It shows how MySQL database works with Django framework</p>
<p></p>
<p>2. Database Design</p>
<p align="justify">Database is critical for all types of website. A good database doesnot allow any form of inconsistency and stores only relevant information in an ordered manner. If a database has inconsistency, it will affect the efficiency and data integrity. For example, If delete anomaly arise upon the deletion of a rown which also forces other usefull data to be lost. As such, the tables need to be normalized. This fulfils the last objective of ensuring data are accurate and retrievd correctly.</p>

<p align="justify">Database files are the key source of information into the system. It is the process of designing database files, which are the key source of information to the system. The files should be properly designed and planned for collection, accumulation, editing and retrieving the required information.</p>

<p align="justify">The organization of data in databse aims to achive three major objectives:
  <ul>
    <li>Data integration</li>
    <li>Data integrity</li>
    <li>Data independence</li>
  </ul>
